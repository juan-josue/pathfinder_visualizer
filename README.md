## about
This path finder visualizer was based off of Tech with Tim's path finder tutorial, I hope to add to this later this year providing it a larger selection of path finding algorithms, namely breadth first search since I will be learning that algorithm later this year in my data strcture's course. I found this tutorial to be incredibly insightful, and a wonderful introduction to the concept of pathfinding!
